                                and scaling profitable companies. When Mark heard about
                                ERC Specialists, he immediately saw the opportunity to help
                                thousands of business owners recover from the pandemic,
                                and he answered the call to lead our company as CEO.
                                Over the last 10 years, Mark has founded and launched 5
                                different companies that each hit $1m in sales in their first
                                12 months in business. During that time as a co-owner and
                                acting CEO, h generated over $30m+ in revenue. As acting
                                CEO for ERC Specialists, he’s had the opportunity to oversee
                                over half a billion dollars of filed credits helping thousands
                                of businesses access COVID-19 relief funds.<br>
                                As the leader of ERC Specialists, Mark drives the company’s
                                strong commitment to its mission of empowering growth,
                                which includes the growth of our employees, customers,
                                community relationships, and affiliates. He’s relentlessly
                                committed to the cause of helping business owners and is
                                working hard each day to make it a reality. Mark has a
                                passion for life, family, and creating solutions that help
                                others. When Mark is not building world-class companies,
                                you’ll find him on an ATV exploring the mountains of
                                Utah, playing basketball with his four sons, or savoring
                                the sweet life with his wife April.
