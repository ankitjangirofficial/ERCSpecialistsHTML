                                    demonstrate that your operations were partially or fully suspended due to a
                                    Covid-19 governmental order. Keep in mind that a government restriction
                                    may have had a direct impact on your operations even though that shutdown
                                    order<br>
                                    wasn't given to you directly.<br><br>
                                    
                                    <b>Important:</b> This qualification only applies during the period of the actual
                                    government order. Since there were very few government shutdown orders
                                    during 2021, the actual shutdown type of this qualification mainly applies to
                                    2020 quarters. However, if the impact of shutdowns affected your business
                                    beyond the actual shutdown period, this qualification may apply.
                                    
                                    Please reference the IRS notices pertaining to suspension qualification:

                                            <b>More than Nominal Impact -</b> The partial suspension from a government
                                            order must have had a more than nominal effect, which means it affected
                                            more than 10% of business operations. This impact can come from a
                                            reduction in business hours of 10% or more, or a suspension of your
                                            business operations that represented 10% or more of gross receipts as
                                            compared to 2019. (This does not mean that a 10% reduction in sales is
                                            required to qualify, but the order must have suspended at least 10% of
                                            your revenue-producing operations.)<br><br>

                                            Hourly example: Government orders required a restaurant to close 2 hours
                                            early due to curfew requirements. The 2 hours represented 15% of the
                                            business working hours. This business qualifies for the period affected by
                                            the government order.<br><br>

                                            Gross receipts example: Government orders required a radiology clinic to
                                            stop elective procedures during Q2 & Q3 of 2020. The business reviewed
                                            its gross receipts for Q2 & Q3 of 2019 and determined that the suspended
                                            elective procedures represented 18% of its total gross receipts during
                                            those quarters. This business qualifies for these two quarters.
